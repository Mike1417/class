	<h2>The story picks up six months after the initial outbreak of the Rage virus, which decimated the population of Great Britain. The infected have starved to death, and NATO forces, led by the U.S. Army, have established a safe zone in London to begin repopulating the city.

The plot follows Don, who had survived the initial outbreak by abandoning his wife, Alice. He is reunited with his children, Tammy and Andy, who were abroad during the outbreak. When the children sneak out of the safe zone to retrieve personal items from their old home, they find Alice alive but infected with the virus.</h2>
	<h3>Release Date: May 11, 2007</h3>
