The Beatles have been making headlines recently with several exciting updates. Sam Mendes is directing a series of biopics, each focusing on a different band member, but these films won’t be ready until at least mid-20281. Additionally, a new documentary titled “Beatles '64,” produced by Martin Scorsese, will stream on Disney+ starting November 29, 2024. This documentary features never-before-seen footage from The Beatles’ first visit to America2. In music news, Luther Vandross has released a cover of The Beatles’ song “Michelle,” adding his unique touch to the classic3. Lastly, The Beatles have released their final song, “Now and Then,” which was originally a John Lennon demo. This song brings together contributions from all four members and is described as a powerful, emotional piece4.</h2>
