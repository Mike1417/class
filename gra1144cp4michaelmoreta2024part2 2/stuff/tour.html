			<h2>The Beatles’ Tours

, one of the most iconic bands in music history, embarked on numerous tours that left an indelible mark on the world. Their early tours in the UK during 1962-1963 laid the groundwork for their explosive international success. In 1964, they made their historic debut in the United States, sparking Beatlemania with their appearance on “The Ed Sullivan Show” and a series of sold-out concerts. Their tours were characterized by unprecedented fan frenzy, with screaming crowds and chaotic scenes at every venue. Despite the challenges, The Beatles continued to tour extensively, including memorable performances in Europe, Asia, and Australia. Their final tour in 1966 marked the end of their live performances, as they shifted focus to studio recordings, creating some of their most influential music.</h2>
